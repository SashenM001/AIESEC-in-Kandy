          Partnership between AIESEC and Dimo

        <p>
          We entered into partnership with AIESEC in Sri Lanka owing to their
          distinguished local impact. Aligned with our corporate ethos of
          community engagement, we are dedicated to empowering youth and
          fulfilling our social responsibility. AIESEC's exemplary track record
          underscores their capacity to facilitate meaningful change, bolstering
          our joint commitment to advancing societal welfare through
          strategic collaboration.

          Why should an AIESECer join Dimo ?
        </h4>
        <p>
          This partnership isn't merely about visibility. We aim to build
          meaningful connections with AIESEC's exceptional network of university
          students, creating a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas and
          perspectives. Through the various activities planned throughout the
          next 12 months, we hope to offer mentorship, and insights into our
          industries, and contribute to shaping the next wave of responsible and
          visionary business leaders. By investing in young talent through
          AIESEC, we position DIMO as a brand that truly understands the power
          of youth, embraces innovation, and supports the future of Sri Lanka.
